## Brainstorming

Trying to make a simple Atari-like controller for a game in the likeness of Vampire Survivors. 

Features;

- a central joystick for continuous movement input. Moving up, down, left, and right is the primary interaction of the game Vampire Survivors. A large joystick front and center makes the device easy for most users to understand.

- an (ideally red) LED that lights up when the player takes damage. Adding visual feedback from the controller is similar to how the Sony Dual sense's lightbar communicates information from simple colour cues. Red is often associated with bad events, so flash red when the player is damaged.

- A speaker will give audio feedback to the player when they are damaged. This could provide audio feedback such as game audio or audio clips from the player's attacks.

I chose a small box design to make it easy to fit all the components I needed inside. I used the Xiao microcontroller we used in the course project because of its size and flexibility.
